## Boldr is a **modern** content management framework.

Written entirely in JavaScript, Boldr is different than most CMF / CMS platforms. Boldr renders all pages on the server.

Server rendering improves performance and allows for a single page application experience without any negative hits to SEO.

Boldr uses Postgres to store your site's content. An Express server runs the API and is used for server-side rendering. Redis provides the store for user sessions and query caching.
