# Install Using Boldr CLI

The CLI for Boldr allows quick scaffolding of a new Boldr project. It is by far the easiest method to get up and running quickly.

Install Boldr CLI using `npm install -g boldr-cli`

Once Boldr CLI is installed, navigate to the directory where you'd like to generate your new project.

Enter the command: `boldr-cli init`

Choose Fullstack and let the installer run.
