# Redux Organization {#redux-organization}

Boldr uses Redux for state management. The redux modules are broken up into multiple files within the state directory. The state directory is located in`packages/boldr-cms/src/shared/state`. Within the state directory you will find the configuration for the application store, the root reducer, and a modules folder.

The modules folder contains directories for different aspects of the state.
